# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
 Purpose: Is to demonstrate ones ability to collect and work with clean data set.
 
 Goal: Is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.


In this repository are the required files for this assignment:

 1) a tidy data set
 
 2) R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
 
  i) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
 ii) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 
 iii) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 
 iv) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 
 v) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
 3) CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
